# YPDL-Identify Handwritten Digits using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow

## About the workshop

Recognizing handwritten numbers is a piece of cake for humans, but it’s a non-trivial task for machines. Currently, however, with the advancement of machine learning, people have made machines more capable of performing this task.

In this second workshop of the Your Path to Deep Learning series, we will use MNIST Dataset to build two Neural Networks capable to perform handwritten digits classification. The first Network is a simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and the second one is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We will show you the step-by-step guide to create a simple handwritten digit recognizer in Watson Studio with TensorFlow.

### 🎓 What will you learn?

Create a project in Watson Studio and use Jupyter Notebook in the project.
Create a simple Multi-layer perceptron (Neural Network), to perform classification tasks.
Create a Deep Learning Neural Network and apply on MNIST.

1.	Login to your IBM Cloud account: https://ibm.biz/YourPathToDeepLearning
 
2.	Within your IBM Cloud account, click on the top search bar to search for cloud services and offerings. Type in “Watson Studio” and then click on Watson Studio under “Catalog Results”.

3.	This takes you to the Watson Studio service page. Select a region, “Lite” plan (Free) and give your service a unique name. Click on “Create” and this creates a Watson Studio instance for you.

4.	Once the service instance is ready, you will be redirected to the Watson Studio page. Click on the “Get Started” button to launch Watson Studio in a new tab. This might take few minutes to set up the service.

5.	Under the heading “work with data” you will find a link that says, “Create a project”. Click on “Create a project”. Next, click on “Create an empty project”.
